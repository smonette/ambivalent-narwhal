			  	<h3>Validating your Reservation</h3>
			  	<p>To validate your reservation, please send the following:</p>
			  	<ul>
				  	<li>Security deposit of $350.00<a href="#" id="security" style="padding-left: 15px;" data-toggle="popover" title="" data-content="Cashier's check or money order ONLY. No Personal Checks!" data-original-title="Acceptable Payment"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign"></span></a>
</li>
				  	<li>Photocopy of Tenant's driver's license</li> 
					<li>Photocopy of Tenant's credit card</li> 
					<li>The signed rental agreement, attached to your confirmation email.</li>
			  	</ul>
			  	<h3>Cancellations</h3>
			   
				<p>The booking/security deposit of $350.00 is never refundable if it 
				becomes necessary to cancel reservation&mdash;dates can be switched if property is available. 
				Once booked and paid for, 65% of account is refundable if notice is given 45+ days prior 
				to occupancy date. If notice is given 30-44 days prior to occupancy, 50% of account is 
				refundable. If notice is given 15-29 days prior to occupancy, 35% of account is 
				refundable. Notice of less than 15 days prior to occupancy warrants no refund of account. 
				Date changes subject to availability. Owner reserves the right to supply Tenant with 
				another of his properties if he cannot supply the exact property requested. Owner will 
				notify Tenant immediately if a change is made.</p>
				<h3>Keys</h3>
				 <p>Access to key will be given approximately three days prior to arrival after full payments 
				are received and all requirements are met. Key(s) and garage opener(s) shall be placed on 
				the kitchen counter when Tenant vacates. Generally when the security deposit is 
				refunded, the original payment form, if possible, will be returned by U.S. mail after 
				Tenant's departure.</p>
